dimpleDemos
===========

This repository is meant to provide interesting Dimple demos.  We could have included these demos directly in the dimple source tree but we wanted to avoid creating a large Dimple repository and most interesting demos require large data sets.

See the demos directory in the dimple repository for the rest of the demos.
